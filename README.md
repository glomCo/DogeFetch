DogeFetch
==============

A physical bot that tracks realtime DOGE values and address balances.

Uses a Raspberry Pi and an IC2-based LED display.

Programmed in Python. (see main.py)

Currently a WIP.

Do It Yourself
==============

If you have a Raspberry Pi Model B with a soldered 16x2 Negative RGB Display+Keypad, feel free to run "DogeFetch.py" after setting up IC2. I will make more comprehensive instructions after testing.
